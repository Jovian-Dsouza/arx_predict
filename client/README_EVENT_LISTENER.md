## Configuration

The script uses the same configuration as your other ArxPredict scripts:

- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Wallet**: Your Solana keypair from `~/.config/solana/id.json`
- **Program**: ArxPredict program ID from your build artifacts
- **Cluster**: Arcium cluster account

## Stopping the Listener

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the event listener. The script will:

1. Remove all event listeners
2. Close connections
3. Exit cleanly

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure your Solana CLI is configured for devnet
- Check that your wallet has sufficient SOL for transaction fees
- Verify the program ID is correct

### No Events Showing
- Make sure the ArxPredict program is deployed and active
- Check that other scripts are actually triggering events
- Verify you're connected to the correct network

### TypeScript Errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check that the build artifacts exist in `target/` directory
- Verify TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`

- `@solana/web3.js` - Solana web3 client
